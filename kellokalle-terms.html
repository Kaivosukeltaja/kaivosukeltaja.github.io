<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

<p>Last updated: January 7th 2026</p>

<p>Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the mobile application Kellokalle (the “App”), available on iOS and Android. The App is developed and maintained as a small, non-commercial hobby project.</p> 

<p>By downloading or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

<h2>1. About the App</h2>

<p>
The App is designed to help track time related to industrial and logistic processes. It allows users to record data and, with an active subscription, export that data as an Excel file using the operating system’s file sharing features.
</p>

<p>
The App is provided “as is” and is intended for general informational and organizational purposes only.
</p>

<h2>2. No Professional or Industrial Guarantee</h2>

<p>
The App is not certified for industrial, safety-critical, legal, accounting, or compliance-related use.
</p>

</p>
You are solely responsible for:
<ul>
    <li>Verifying the accuracy of any data recorded or exported</li>
    <li>Deciding whether the App is suitable for your specific use case</li>
    <li>Any decisions or actions taken based on the App’s output</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>

<p>
    Certain features, including exporting data as an Excel file, require an active subscription.
</p>

<p>
    Subscriptions are available on a:
    
    <ul>
        <li>Monthly basis, or</li>
        <li>Yearly basis</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Payments and renewals are handled entirely by Apple App Store or Google Play, depending on your device. The developer does not process or store payment information.
</p>

<p>
    Subscription management (including cancellation) must be done through your platform’s account settings.
</p>

<h2>4. Data and File Export</h2>

<p>
    Data entered into the App is stored locally on your device unless otherwise stated.
</p>

<p>
    Exported Excel files are generated on your device and shared using the operating system’s file sharing functionality (e.g., Expo file sharing).
</p>

<p>
    The developer does not receive or store your exported files.
</p>

<p>
    You are responsible for backing up and safeguarding any exported data.
</p>

<h2>5. Availability and Changes</h2>

<p>
    The App may be updated, changed, paused, or discontinued at any time without notice.
</p>

<p>
    Features (including subscription features) may evolve or be removed as the App is maintained as a hobby project with limited resources.
</p>

<h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The App is provided without warranties of any kind
    </li>
    <li>
        The developer shall not be liable for any direct or indirect damages, data loss, business interruption, or other issues arising from the use or inability to use the App
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Use of the App is entirely at your own risk.
</p>

<h2>7. Termination</h2>

<p>
    You may stop using the App at any time. These Terms will automatically stop applying once you uninstall the App, except where required by law.
</p>

<p>
    The developer may restrict or discontinue access to the App at any time.
</p>

<h2>
8. Changes to These Terms
</h2>

<p>These Terms may be updated occasionally. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
